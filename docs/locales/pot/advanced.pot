msgstr ""

#: ../../advanced.rst:500
msgid "You might also want to add ``--ignore-pipfile`` to ``pipenv install``, as to not accidentally modify the lock-file on each test run. This causes Pipenv to ignore changes to the ``Pipfile`` and (more importantly) prevents it from adding the current environment to ``Pipfile.lock``. This might be important as the current environment (i.e. the virtualenv provisioned by tox) will usually contain the current project (which may or may not be desired) and additional dependencies from ``tox``'s ``deps`` directive. The initial provisioning may alternatively be disabled by adding ``skip_install = True`` to tox.ini."

In these cases, the virtual environment can be created with access to the system `site-packages` directory::"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../advanced.rst:560
msgid "Libraries provide reusable functionality to other libraries and applications (let's use the umbrella term **projects** here). They are required to work alongside other libraries, all with their own set of subdependencies. They define **abstract dependencies**. To avoid version conflicts in subdependencies of different libraries within a project, libraries should never ever pin dependency versions. Although they may specify lower or (less frequently) upper bounds, if they rely on some specific feature/fix/bug. Library dependencies are specified via ``install_requires`` in ``setup.py``."

msgid "For applications, define **dependencies and where to get them** in the `Pipfile` and use this file to update the set of **concrete dependencies** in ``Pipfile.lock``. This file defines a specific idempotent environment that is known to work for your project. The ``Pipfile.lock`` is your source of truth. The ``Pipfile`` is a convenience for you to create that lock-file, in that it allows you to still remain somewhat vague about the exact version of a dependency to be used. Pipenv is there to help you define a working conflict-free set of specific dependency-versions, which would otherwise be a very tedious task."
