msgid "It will show you how to install and use the necessary tools and make strong recommendations on best practices. Keep in mind that Python is used for a great many different purposes, and precisely how you want to manage your dependencies may change based on how you decide to publish your software. The guidance presented here is most directly applicable to the development and deployment of network services (including web applications), but is also very well suited to managing development and testing environments for any kind of project."

msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:70
msgid ":ref:`Pipenv` is a dependency manager for Python projects. If you're familiar with Node.js' `npm`_ or Ruby's `bundler`_, it is similar in spirit to those tools. While :ref:`pip` can install Python packages, Pipenv is recommended as it's a higher-level tool that simplifies dependency management for common use cases."

#: ../../install.rst:83
msgid "This does a `user installation`_ to prevent breaking any system-wide packages. If ``pipenv`` isn't available in your shell after installation, you'll need to add the `user base`_'s ``bin`` directory to your ``PATH``. You can find the user base by running ``python -m site`` which will print site information including the user base. For example, on Linux this will return ``USER_BASE: '~/.local'`` so you'll need to add ``~/.local/bin`` to your ``PATH``. On Linux and macOS you can set your ``PATH`` permanently by `modifying ~/.profile`_. On Windows you can set the user ``PATH`` permanently in the `Control Panel`_."
