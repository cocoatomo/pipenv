msgid "It will show you how to install and use the necessary tools and make strong recommendations on best practices. Keep in mind that Python is used for a great many different purposes, and precisely how you want to manage your dependencies may change based on how you decide to publish your software. The guidance presented here is most directly applicable to the development and deployment of network services (including web applications), but is also very well suited to managing development and testing environments for any kind of project."

#: ../../install.rst:32

msgid "If you installed Python from source, with an installer from `python.org`_, or via `Homebrew`_ you should already have pip. If you're on Linux and installed using your OS package manager, you may have to `install pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_ separately."

msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:71
msgid ":ref:`Pipenv` is a dependency manager for Python projects. If you're familiar with Node.js' `npm`_ or Ruby's `bundler`_, it is similar in spirit to those tools. While :ref:`pip` can install Python packages, Pipenv is recommended as it's a higher-level tool that simplifies dependency management for common use cases."

msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:89
msgid "On Linux and macOS you can find the user base binary directory by running ``python -m site --user-base`` and adding ``bin`` to the end. For example, this will typically print ``~/.local`` (with ``~`` expanded to the absolute path to your home directory) so you'll need to add ``~/.local/bin`` to your ``PATH``. You can set your ``PATH`` permanently by `modifying ~/.profile`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:96
msgid "On Windows you can find the user base binary directory by running ``py -m site --user-site`` and replacing ``site-packages`` with ``Scripts``. For example, this could return ``C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python36\\site-packages`` so you would need to set your ``PATH`` to include ``C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python36\\Scripts``. You can set your user ``PATH`` permanently in the `Control Panel`_. You may need to log out for the ``PATH`` changes to take effect."
