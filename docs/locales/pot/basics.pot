msgid "‚ò§ Importing from requirements.txt"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:129
msgid "If you only have a ``requirements.txt`` file available when running ``pipenv install``, pipenv will automatically import the contents of this file and create a ``Pipfile`` for you."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:132
msgid "You can also specify ``$ pipenv install -r path/to/requirements.txt`` to import a requirements file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:134
msgid "Note, that when importing a requirements file, they often have version numbers pinned, which you likely won't want in your ``Pipfile``, so you'll have to manually update your ``Pipfile`` afterwards to reflect this."

msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:153
msgid "To create a new virtualenv, using a specific version of Python you have installed (and on your ``PATH``), use the ``--python VERSION`` flag, like so:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:170
msgid "If a ``Pipfile`` hasn't been created yet, one will be created for you, that looks like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:183
msgid "Note the inclusion of ``[requires] python_version = \"3.6\"``. This specifies that your application requires this version of Python, and will be used automatically when running ``pipenv install`` against this ``Pipfile`` in the future (e.g. on other machines). If this is not true, feel free to simply remove this section."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:187
msgid "If you don't specify a Python version on the command‚Äìline, either the ``[requires]`` ``python_full_version`` or ``python_version`` will be selected automatically, falling back to whatever your system's default ``python`` installation is, at time of execution."

msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:208
msgid "If you have `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#simple-python-version-management-pyenv>`_ installed and configured, Pipenv will automatically ask you if you want to install a required version of Python if you don't already have it available."

msgid "This is a very fancy feature, and we're very proud of it::"

#: ../../basics.rst:251

msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:266
msgid "The user can provide these additional parameters:"

#: ../../basics.rst:268
msgid "``--two`` ‚Äî Performs the installation in a virtualenv using the system ``python2`` link."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:269
msgid "``--three`` ‚Äî Performs the installation in a virtualenv using the system ``python3`` link."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:270
msgid "``--python`` ‚Äî Performs the installation in a virtualenv using the provided Python interpreter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:272
msgid "None of the above commands should be used together. They are also **destructive** and will delete your current virtualenv before replacing it with an appropriately versioned one."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:276
msgid "The virtualenv created by Pipenv may be different from what you were expecting. Dangerous characters (i.e. ``$`!*@\"`` as well as space, line feed, carriage return, and tab) are converted to underscores. Additionally, the full path to the current folder is encoded into a \"slug value\" and appended to ensure the virtualenv name is unique."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:282
msgid "``--dev`` ‚Äî Install both ``develop`` and ``default`` packages from ``Pipfile.lock``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:283

msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:285

msgid "``--all`` ‚Äî This parameter will purge all files from the virtual environment, but leave the Pipfile untouched."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:302
msgid "$ pipenv lock"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:304
msgid "``$ pipenv lock`` is used to create a ``Pipfile.lock``, which declares **all** dependencies (and sub-dependencies) of your project, their latest available versions, and the current hashes for the downloaded files. This ensures repeatable, and most importantly *deterministic*, builds."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:307
msgid "‚ò§ About Shell Configuration"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:309
msgid "Shells are typically misconfigured for subshell use, so ``$ pipenv shell --fancy`` may produce unexpected results. If this is the case, try ``$ pipenv shell``, which uses \"compatibility mode\", and will attempt to spawn a subshell despite misconfiguration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:311
msgid "A proper shell configuration only sets environment variables like ``PATH`` during a login session, not during every subshell spawn (as they are typically configured to do). In fish, this looks like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:317
msgid "You should do this for your shell too, in your ``~/.profile`` or ``~/.bashrc`` or wherever appropriate."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:319
msgid "The shell launched in interactive mode. This means that if your shell reads its configuration from a specific file for interactive mode (e.g. bash by default looks for a ``~/.bashrc`` configuration file for interactive mode), then you'll need to modify (or create) this file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:323
msgid "‚ò§ A Note about VCS Dependencies"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:325
msgid "Pipenv will resolve the sub‚Äìdepencies of VCS dependencies, but only if they are editable, like so::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:330
msgid "If editable is not true, sub‚Äìdependencies will not get resolved."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:334
msgid "‚ò§ Pipfile.lock Security Features"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:336
msgid "``Pipfile.lock`` takes advantage of some great new security improvements in ``pip``. By default, the ``Pipfile.lock`` will be generated with the sha256 hashes of each downloaded package. This will allow ``pip`` to guarantee you're installing what you intend to when on a compromised network, or downloading dependencies from an untrusted PyPI endpoint."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:341
msgid "We highly recommend approaching deployments with promoting projects from a development environment into production. You can use ``pipenv lock`` to compile your dependencies on your development environment and deploy the compiled ``Pipfile.lock`` to all of your production environments for reproducible builds."
