msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:283
msgid "The virtualenv created by Pipenv may be different from what you were expecting. Dangerous characters (i.e. ``$`!*@\"`` as well as space, line feed, carriage return, and tab) are converted to underscores. Additionally, the full path to the current folder is encoded into a \"slug value\" and appended to ensure the virtualenv name is unique."

msgid "``--dev`` — Install both ``develop`` and ``default`` packages from ``Pipfile.lock``."

msgstr ""

msgid "☤ About Shell Configuration"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:319
msgid "Shells are typically misconfigured for subshell use, so ``$ pipenv shell --fancy`` may produce unexpected results. If this is the case, try ``$ pipenv shell``, which uses \"compatibility mode\", and will attempt to spawn a subshell despite misconfiguration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:321
msgid "A proper shell configuration only sets environment variables like ``PATH`` during a login session, not during every subshell spawn (as they are typically configured to do). In fish, this looks like this::"

#: ../../basics.rst:329

#: ../../basics.rst:349
msgid "☤ Pipfile.lock Security Features"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:351
msgid "``Pipfile.lock`` takes advantage of some great new security improvements in ``pip``. By default, the ``Pipfile.lock`` will be generated with the sha256 hashes of each downloaded package. This will allow ``pip`` to guarantee you're installing what you intend to when on a compromised network, or downloading dependencies from an untrusted PyPI endpoint."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:356
msgid "We highly recommend approaching deployments with promoting projects from a development environment into production. You can use ``pipenv lock`` to compile your dependencies on your development environment and deploy the compiled ``Pipfile.lock`` to all of your production environments for reproducible builds."
