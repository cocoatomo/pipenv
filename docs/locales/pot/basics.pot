#: ../../basics.rst:129
msgid "If you only have a ``requirements.txt`` file available when running ``pipenv install``, pipenv will automatically import the contents of this file and create a ``Pipfile`` for you."

#: ../../basics.rst:132
msgid "You can also specify ``$ pipenv install -r path/to/requirements.txt`` to import a requirements file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:134
msgid "Note, that when importing a requirements file, they often have version numbers pinned, which you likely won't want in your ``Pipfile``, so you'll have to manually update your ``Pipfile`` afterwards to reflect this."

msgid "To tell pipenv to install a specific version of a library, the usage is simple::"

#: ../../basics.rst:153
msgid "To create a new virtualenv, using a specific version of Python you have installed (and on your ``PATH``), use the ``--python VERSION`` flag, like so:"

#: ../../basics.rst:170
msgid "If a ``Pipfile`` hasn't been created yet, one will be created for you, that looks like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:183
msgid "Note the inclusion of ``[requires] python_version = \"3.6\"``. This specifies that your application requires this version of Python, and will be used automatically when running ``pipenv install`` against this ``Pipfile`` in the future (e.g. on other machines). If this is not true, feel free to simply remove this section."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:187
msgid "If you don't specify a Python version on the command–line, either the ``[requires]`` ``python_full_version`` or ``python_version`` will be selected automatically, falling back to whatever your system's default ``python`` installation is, at time of execution."

#: ../../basics.rst:211

#: ../../basics.rst:219
msgid "``$ pipenv install`` is used for installing packages into the pipenv virtual environment and updating your Pipfile."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:222
msgid "Along with the basic install command, which takes the form::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:226
msgid "The user can provide these additional parameters:"

#: ../../basics.rst:228
msgid "``--two`` — Performs the installation in a virtualenv using the system ``python2`` link."

#: ../../basics.rst:229
msgid "``--three`` — Performs the installation in a virtualenv using the system ``python3`` link."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:230
msgid "``--python`` — Performs the installation in a virtualenv using the provided Python interpreter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:232
msgid "None of the above commands should be used together. They are also **destructive** and will delete your current virtualenv before replacing it with an appropriately versioned one."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:236
msgid "The virtualenv created by Pipenv may be different from what you were expecting. Dangerous characters (i.e. ``$`!*@\"`` as well as space, line feed, carriage return, and tab) are converted to underscores. Additionally, the full path to the current folder is encoded into a \"slug value\" and appended to ensure the virtualenv name is unique."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:242
msgid "``--dev`` — Install both ``develop`` and ``default`` packages from ``Pipfile.lock``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:243
msgid "``--system`` — Use the system ``pip`` command rather than the one from your virtualenv."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:244
msgid "``--ignore-pipfile`` — Ignore the ``Pipfile`` and install from the ``Pipfile.lock``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:245
msgid "``--skip-lock`` — Ignore the ``Pipfile.lock`` and install from the ``Pipfile``. In addition, do not write out a ``Pipfile.lock`` reflecting changes to the ``Pipfile``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:250
msgid "$ pipenv uninstall"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:252
msgid "``$ pipenv uninstall`` supports all of the parameters in `pipenv install <#pipenv-install>`_, as well as one additonal, ``--all``."
msgstr ""

msgid "``--all`` — This parameter will purge all files from the virtual environment, but leave the Pipfile untouched."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:262
msgid "$ pipenv lock"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:264
msgid "``$ pipenv lock`` is used to create a ``Pipfile.lock``, which declares **all** dependencies (and sub-dependencies) of your project, their latest available versions, and the current hashes for the downloaded files. This ensures repeatable, and most importantly *deterministic*, builds."

msgid "☤ About Shell Configuration"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:269
msgid "Shells are typically misconfigured for subshell use, so ``$ pipenv shell --fancy`` may produce unexpected results. If this is the case, try ``$ pipenv shell``, which uses \"compatibility mode\", and will attempt to spawn a subshell despite misconfiguration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:271
msgid "A proper shell configuration only sets environment variables like ``PATH`` during a login session, not during every subshell spawn (as they are typically configured to do). In fish, this looks like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:277
msgid "You should do this for your shell too, in your ``~/.profile`` or ``~/.bashrc`` or wherever appropriate."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:279
msgid "The shell launched in interactive mode. This means that if your shell reads its configuration from a specific file for interactive mode (e.g. bash by default looks for a ``~/.bashrc`` configuration file for interactive mode), then you'll need to modify (or create) this file."

msgid "☤ A Note about VCS Dependencies"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:285
msgid "Pipenv will resolve the sub–depencies of VCS dependencies, but only if they are editable, like so::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:290
msgid "If editable is not true, sub–dependencies will not get resolved."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:294
msgid "☤ Pipfile.lock Security Features"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:296
msgid "``Pipfile.lock`` takes advantage of some great new security improvements in ``pip``. By default, the ``Pipfile.lock`` will be generated with the sha256 hashes of each downloaded package. This will allow ``pip`` to guarantee you're installing what you intend to when on a compromised network, or downloading dependencies from an untrusted PyPI endpoint."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:301
msgid "We highly recommend approaching deployments with promoting projects from a development environment into production. You can use ``pipenv lock`` to compile your dependencies on your development environment and deploy the compiled ``Pipfile.lock`` to all of your production environments for reproducible builds."
