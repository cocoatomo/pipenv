Frequently Encountered Pipenv Problems
======================================

Pipenv is constantly being improved by volunteers, but we have limited
resources, and Pipenv is still a very young project, and has some quirks that
needs to be dealt with. We need everyone’s help (including yours!).

Here are some common questions people have using Pipenv. Please take a look
below and see if they resolve your problem.

.. Note:: **Make sure you’re running the newest Pipenv version first!**

☤ Your dependencies could not be resolved
-----------------------------------------

Make sure your dependencies actually *do* resolve. If you’re confident they
are, you may need to clear your resolver cache. Run the following command::

    pipenv-resolver --clear

And try again.

Pipenv does not install prereleases (i.e. a version with an alpha/beta/etc.
suffix, such as *1.0b1*) by default. You will need to pass the ``--pre`` flag
in your command, or set

::

    [pipenv]
    allow_prereleases = true

in your Pipfile.

☤ No module named <module name>
---------------------------------

This is usually a result of mixing Pipenv with system packages. We *strongly*
recommend installing Pipenv in an isolated environment. Uninstall all existing
Pipenv installations, and see :ref:`proper_installation` to choose one of the
recommended way to install Pipenv instead.

☤ My pyenv-installed Python is not found
----------------------------------------

Make sure you have ``PYENV_ROOT`` set correctly. Pipenv only supports CPython
distributions.

☤ ``shell`` does not show the virtualenv’s name in prompt
---------------------------------------------------------

This is intentional. You can do it yourself with either shell plugins, or
clever ``PS1`` configuration. If you really want it back, use

::

    pipenv shell -c

instead (not available on Windows).

☤ Pipenv does not respect dependencies in setup.py
--------------------------------------------------

No, it does not, intentionally. Pipfile and setup.py serve different purposes,
and should not consider each other by default. See :ref:`pipfile-vs-setuppy`
for more information.
